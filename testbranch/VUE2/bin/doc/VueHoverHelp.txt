Help descriptions


1. Content 

The Content window supplies content, such as files or images, accessed from your computer or a searchable resource, that can be dragged to the Map window.

2. Resources 

Resources are the locations where content may be found, either from remote systems such as digital repositories, or from your computer. A resource can be searched by placing a check – or can be browsed if selecting it opens the browse tab. Additional resources can be added through the “Add Resources” side menu.

3. My Saved Content

My Saved Content is a listing much like Bookmarks. When content is dragged onto the My Saved Content panel, a copy is made available for ready access. When working offline, remote files cannot be accessed. Additional panels can be created through the “Add Resources” side menu.

4. Search

The Search panel allows searching of all checked resources simultaneously. Clicking “More options” provides additional search fields common to the selected resources.

5. Properties

The context sensitive Info window displays additional information on the current selection such as a file or node. 

6. Add a resource

Select a resource from the list below and click “Add” to add to the Resource panel. Some resources will need configuration or acceptance of a license agreement.

7. Notes

Use the Notes field to add descriptive information to the selected node or link.

8. Pathways

The Pathways feature in VUE allows the creation of custom "trails" through nodes in maps providing learners with a sequenced manner of exploring resources. This is useful for highlighting particular nodes in large maps to show relationships or subsets of data.

9. Outline

The Outline displays the contents of the map as a hierarchy.

10. Map Info

Map Info displays data specific to the map.  It contains an Info tab for map description and properties, a Metadata tab to define metadata elements, and a Filter tab to analyze the map based on metadata.
