<h1>OKI Filing API demos: Cabinet utilities</h1>
</p>
<p>
Four  utilities are provided here.
<ul>
<li><b>CabList</b> - a cabinet lister
<li><b>CabViewer</b> - a cabinet viewer (Java Swing GUI)
<li><b>CabSync</b> - a cabinet synchronizer
<li><b>CabSyncViewer</b> - a visual cabinet synchronizer (Java Swing GUI)
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Building</h2>The script <code><b>build.sh</b></code> will compile
everything (it runs javac *.java and dumps the classes the build
directory).  It must be run in the current directory.  This script
ALSO conveniently jars all the OKI code needed to support running the
file demos, and puts it in <code>filingAll.jar</code>, which is all
you will need to run all these demos.  So either set your classpath to
filingAll.jar, or run <br><code>java -cp filingAll.jar <i>(cabdemo of
your choice -- see below)</i></code>
<h2>Running</h2>

Simply run <b><code>java CabList <i>cabinet1</i></code></b> to run.<br>
E.g.:<dd><b><code>java CabList /tmp</code></b></dd>
or if you haven't set your classpath:<br>
<dd><b><code>java -cp filingAll.jar CabList /tmp</code></b></dd>
<br>
CabList and and CabViewer can be given multiple cabinet arguments to
view.  The CabSync and CabSyncViewer both take two cabinet arguments
exactly.  These two also take additional option arguments:
<ul>
<li><b>-verbose</b>: turn on some info messages
<li><b>-debug</b>: turn on debugging messages
</ul>
CabSyncViewer also takes:
<ul>
<li><b>-poll <i>seconds</i></b>: number of seconds between automatic checks for changes in the cabinet.  Default is 30.  Setting to 0 will turn off polling.
<li><b>-show_ghosts</b>: an alternative way to display cabinets with their potential entries.  (Originally implemented as
a way to see more about what's going on in a smaller display with only the local directory showing).
</ul>
<h2>Cabinet Specifiers</h2>

You can use the name of any local directory as a cabinet, and it will
be accessed through the local filesystem implementation (Lfs).  For
the moment, these utilities have piggy-backed off the URL spec for
accessing other implementations.  If you specify a cabinet as an ftp
url, e.g. <code>ftp:///tmp</code> or
<nobr><code>ftp://host:port/tmp</code></nobr>, the remote filesystem
interface will be used (Rfs), although it will NOT contact a server --
this is just a way to test the working order of some of the Rfs code
without having to have a server around (so host and port are ignored
for ftp URL's).  If you specify an HTTP URL, these utilities will
actually attempt to contact a ROMI server.  So,
<code>http://localhost:2500/tmp</code> will look for a server on your
local machine running at port 2500 and then ask it for /tmp.  Be sure
you've specified a policy file for both your server and client that is
going to allow you access.  A default policy file in this directory,
all.policy, which these utilities use if you don't specify another
policy file, sets up the client side for total access.  You can
override this by specifying the
<code>java.security.policy</code> property on the java command line.
<h2>CabSync & CabSyncViewer</h2>

These utilities are usable, though not appropriate for significant
use.  These are demonstration applications.  In particular, if
an error occurs in transmission -- e.g., you drop your network
connection, you could be left with partial files.  CabSync is a single
pass command sync line utility that acts like a CabSyncViewer that's
requested a single sync and then exited (they use the same underlying
code).
<h2>The CabSyncViewer GUI</h2>

Items in <b><font color="red">red</font></b> are old compaired to the other
cabinet, and will be overwritten on sync.  Items in <b><font
color=green>green</font></b> are new, and will be copied on top of
something else on a sync.  Items in <b><font color=orange>orange</font></b>
are in conflict and are ignored -- you have to resolve those yourself.
Items displayed faintly are "ghosts" (if you turn on
<nobr>-show_ghosts</nobr>) and represent items that will exist after
you sync.  Turning on "AutoSync" will cause a sync to happen as soon
as any changes are detected.  The Upload/Download buttons synchronize
only items that would result in moving data either up from the local
cabinet or down from the remote cabinet.  Currently, files beginning
with "." are completey ignored -- neither displayed or synchronized.
